  <meta name="twitter:description" content="The blog post by ZDNet made it to HackerNews front page. Do engage in discussion there, and show us love by giving us a GitHub star.
I&rsquo;m really excited to announce that Dgraph has raised $11.5M in Series A funding. This round is led by Redpoint Ventures, with investment from our previous lead, Bain Capital Ventures, and participation from all our existing investors &ndash; Blackbird, Grok and AirTree. With this round, Satish Dharmaraj joins Dgraph&rsquo;s board of directors, which includes Salil Deshpande from Bain and myself."/>

<h3 id="the-open-secret">The open secret</h3>

<p><em>The graph database space is not as &ldquo;sexy&rdquo; as the relational database space.</em></p>

<p>While every venture which changes the hairstyle of the SQL horse gets money
thrown at them, investing in the graph car is a way more judicious call. It
requires recognition of the fact that datasets are getting more complex while
databases serving them have stayed largely the same for the last 20 years,
causing companies to stick graph solutions on top of relational databases with
spit and tape.</p>

<p>It is tempting to brush off the graph problem as a <em>niche.</em>  <strong>But, when you see
the same problem being solved at many different companies with millions of
dollars being spent, the word <em>niche</em> doesn&rsquo;t come to mind.</strong> A
look at the state of these solutions is enough to give an idea for the need of a
scalable graph database. Here are some excerpts taken from published information
about graph efforts being done at companies along with relevant links.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; allowed developers to read and write the objects (nodes) and associations
(edges) in the graph, and direct access to MySQL was deprecated for data types
that fit the model.  TAO implements a graph abstraction directly, allowing it
to avoid some of the fundamental shortcomings of a lookaside cache
architecture. TAO continues to use MySQL for persistent storage, but mediates
access to the database and uses its own graph-aware cache. <strong>&mdash; Facebook</strong>
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc13/atc13-bronson.pdf">TAO</a></p>

<p>As Airbnb moves towards becoming an end-to-end travel platform, it is
increasingly important for us to deliver travel insights &hellip;  To scale our
ability to answer these travel queries, we needed a systematic approach to
storing and serving high-quality information about entities &hellip; and the
relationships between them &hellip; spent the past year building a knowledge graph
<strong>&mdash; Airbnb</strong> <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/contextualizing-airbnb-by-building-knowledge-graph-b7077e268d5a">Knowledge Graph</a></p>

<p>Having to write SQL and interact with MySQL directly impacted developer
productivity. In the same vein, schema evolution was brittle and error-prone.
Edgestore is a service and abstraction over thousands of MySQL nodes that
provides users with strongly consistent, transactional reads and writes at low
latency.  Objects in Edgestore can be Entities or Associations &hellip;
Associations describe how different Entities relate to each other
<strong>&mdash; Dropbox</strong> <a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2016/08/reintroducing-edgestore/">Edgestore</a> and <a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/11/cross-shard-transactions-at-10-million-requests-per-second/">again</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;who’s following both of these users?” These features are difficult to
implement in a traditional relational database.  Our goals were: Write the
simplest possible thing that could work.  FlockDB is a database that stores
graph data, but it isn’t a database optimized for graph-traversal operations.
<strong>&mdash; Twitter</strong> <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/a/2010/introducing-flockdb.html">FlockDB</a></p>

<p>However, building systems that provide such recommendations presents a major
challenge due to a massive pool of items, a large number of users, and
requirements for recommendations to be responsive to user actions and
generated on demand in real-time. Here we present Pixie, a scalable
graph-based real-time recommender system that we developed and deployed.
<strong>&mdash; Pinterest</strong> <a href="https://labs.pinterest.com/user/themes/pin_labs/assets/paper/paper-pixie.pdf">Pixie</a></p>

<p>What do these queries have in common?  Deep, complex join structure. Large
fan-out and Skew. What do we need? Fast and efficient joins.  Without Graph,
client handles Query, moves data to client’s query processor. Limited number of
entities can be fetched due to client’s network bandwidth limitation, cannot
execute large fan-out queries. Latency for multi-hop queries can be prohibitive
due to too many roundtrips to data tier. Limited opportunities for query
optimization. <strong>&mdash; LinkedIn</strong> <a href="https://e.humanities.uva.nl/gsb15/keynote/SweeLim.pdf">Liquid</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>In addition to these, I have written about Google&rsquo;s efforts about graphs
<a href="https://blog.dgraph.io/post/why-google-needed-graph-serving-system/">here</a> and there&rsquo;s a presentation by Uber <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ubers-graph-expert-bears-the-scars-of-billions-of-trips/">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>All of the above are Silicon Valley companies. Let&rsquo;s make a simple extrapolation
to judge how much money is being thrown at this problem. A senior backend
engineer would on average cost 250K in the bay area (base salary, bonus, equity,
medical, perks). Assuming that on average these projects each
have 10 engineers working on them (backend and devops), it costs the company
around $2.5M a year to build a new graph system.</p>

<p>We are talking about <em>an entirely new graph system.</em> In most cases, this new
system is a database, built on top of a SQL DB. Having done this
<a href="https://github.com/manishrjain/gocrud">before</a>, I can safely say that <strong>building a graph database on top of
another database, is like building a SQL database on top of CSV files.</strong> You get
some of the functionality quickly, but you don&rsquo;t get any of the guarantees. And
the rest of the functionality (speed, indices, transactions) would drag out the
engineering efforts until you have almost built an actual database, something
that most likely you were trying to avoid by using an existing one.</p>

<h3 id="graph-layer-on-top-of-sql-what-doesn-t-work">Graph layer on top of SQL: What doesn&rsquo;t work?</h3>

<p>The typical design pattern here is building a graph layer on top of many MySQL
database instances. It has obvious advantages: Horizontal scalability, flexible
schema, simpler data models and graph operations. But it comes with a lot of
downsides. So, what doesn&rsquo;t work?</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Performance:</strong> This is a big killer. The performance of a graph layer would
never match what&rsquo;s possible when the database and storage itself is
optimized for graph operations. In addition, a typical graph query can have
a large fan-out of millions of intermediate results. Having to repeatedly
query and retrieve all that data from DB to the graph layer significantly
affects query latency and throughput.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Indexing:</strong> Indexing is the real power that databases bring to the user.
They make queries search for information fast.
The typical storage model used by TAO and others is to store a graph edge as
a row in the DB. This model does not inform the meaning of the predicate to
the DB.  For example, an edge containing a date can&rsquo;t be indexed differently
from an edge containing a string or a node.  The indexing logic which would
understand graph edges would need to be handled outside by the layer.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Transactions:</strong> While a SQL DB can provide transactions, hundreds of isolated
SQL instances can&rsquo;t provide transaction across them.  This
affects correctness particularly when many edges form a subgraph, which
could be located across different instances, causing them to be updated by
different transactions (we&rsquo;ll touch upon NewSQL databases later).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Correctness:</strong> If indices are not being managed by the database (and
additionally, transactions don&rsquo;t cover data and index manipulation
together), then any given read can be inconsistent. For example, a user can
show as having written a comment, but the list of comments on the post might
not reflect that user or might not show the correct comment count. In fact,
<em>(I would bet that) a sophisticated Jepsen bank test should immediately fail
on any of the graph layer databases built.</em> All that correctness logic would
need to be handled by the application, which means more custom code in the
backend.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Replication:</strong> An eventually consistent replication per DB instance (as provided
by MySQL) married with the serialization of a subgraph across many instances
would produce nondeterministic snapshots, to say the least.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All of these problems are hard to solve. In certain situations, it might be okay
to just ignore those problems, but <strong>that decision inherently causes the solution
to be too custom to be generally adopted by other companies or even worse, other
use-cases within the same company.</strong></p>

<p>Some of these issues can be alleviated by using a NewSQL database, which
provides horizontal scalability with distributed transactions. However, even a
NewSQL database implementing a graph layer would not solve the performance
and indexing issues. And performance as a requirement itself changes solutions
dramatically.</p>

<h3 id="why-build-custom-graph-solutions">Why build custom graph solutions?</h3>

<p>If most consumer facing companies would not spend <em>a penny</em> on building a new SQL
database, then why would they spend millions of dollars on building a new graph
database? Truth be told, <strong>the existing graph database offerings are not as
mature.</strong> Many of these companies mentioned above, did try to find a scalable,
fast graph database that can meet their needs. <em>They couldn&rsquo;t.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the time, we didn’t have a production-ready graph database &mdash; <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/contextualizing-airbnb-by-building-knowledge-graph-b7077e268d5a">Airbnb</a></p>

<p>At the time, no off-the-shelf solution met all our requirements &mdash;
<a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2016/08/reintroducing-edgestore/">Dropbox</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, they abandoned the search and built something in-house. But that
approach only works for a select few.</p>

<p><strong>Most companies do not have the capability or the desire to spend millions of
dollars on building a custom graph database.</strong> Yet, they do have the same needs
as experienced by these above mentioned companies &mdash; horizontal scalability,
performance, multiple data silos or models which need to be served together,
treating relationships just as importantly as the data itself, avoiding
denormalization and data duplication, flexible schema, and simplifying their
backends by making the database do more than just arranging things in rows and
columns.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as with building any new system, particularly a database, it takes
years of effort to wrinkle out all the issues and make it work in a general
enough way that it can be applied to multiple use-cases. <em>Even then, the results
are not a given.</em> Projects get <em>&ldquo;sunset&rdquo;</em>: Twitter FlockDB <a href="https://github.com/twitter-archive/flockdb">lays abandoned</a>
since its initial launch. So, making that large engineering bet to build a graph
layer, which might not work out, is a serious decision.</p>

<p><strong>That&rsquo;s exactly what inspired the creation of Dgraph.</strong></p>

<h3 id="what-makes-dgraph-different">What makes Dgraph different?</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph">Dgraph</a> is built to provide low-latency, high throughput query execution even
with arbitrary depth joins and large fan-outs over massive datasets. And instead
of being a hastily put custom solution on top of SQL, Dgraph is designed from
scratch to execute well on both graph style joins and traversals, and SQL style
selects.</p>

<p><strong>Dgraph solves all five problems listed above.</strong> It provides horizontal
scalability, performance, index consistency, transactional guarantees,
correctness and synchronous replication: all the things which a database must
have to allow applications to predict database behavior and simplify logic. We
have spent years of effort into ensuring that it would NOT lose data or break
transactional guarantees under varied edge cases and would continue to function
despite experiencing network partitions, disk failures, and machine failures.
In fact, <strong>Dgraph is the only graph database to have been <a href="http://jepsen.io/analyses/dgraph-1-0-2">Jepsen
tested</a></strong> (and passes them in all recent releases).</p>

<p>Most other graph databases or layers are built as sidekicks. There&rsquo;s a primary
DB which stores the data and then there&rsquo;s a graph system which gives the ability
to run some specific operations.</p>

<p><em>That was never the vision for Dgraph.</em></p>

<p>While the graph market itself is <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-02-18-gartner-identifies-top-10-data-and-analytics-technolo">slated to grow</a> 100% each year and
enough to generate profits for any vendor, we always designed Dgraph to be a
general purpose database with a graph backend. In essence, <strong>it is designed to
hold the source of truth and it is being used to do so by both our open source
and paid users, including Fortune 500 companies.</strong></p>

<p>The power of Dgraph lies in both providing a flexible schema and the ability to
run complex queries fast effortlessly. We couldn&rsquo;t have expressed these benefits
when compared to other DBs better than one of the Dgraph users building a sport
social media platform:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In our experience of using NoSQL databases such as MongoDB, we enjoyed the
ability to just insert data and immediately make queries to the database
without the need to define quite a rigid schema, though in the long run, as
our applications get complex, the toll was the inability to make complex
queries with the frequent need of multiple joins. The case against a SQL
database was the database management and administration of schemas
gets cumbersome, especially for a small team without dedicated DBAs. We
frequently encounter problems between syncing schemas between different
environments, e.g: SIT, UAT, PROD.  Another big issue regarding SQL databases
is horizontal scaling. Open sources databases we have experience in such as
PostgreSQL, does not have a builtin/native support for horizontal scaling
methods such as sharding (though there are third-party extensions that add
sharding capability like Citus). These are issues that Dgraph is
proactively solving.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>

<p><strong>Dgraph provides a great solution for graph problems and an even better
solution for apps.</strong> Most data models have relationships which need to be taken
into account to execute queries and Dgraph can simplify data models quite
significantly while improving query performance.</p>

<p>The most common use case that <a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph">Dgraph</a> is solving is to <strong>unify multiple data silos</strong>
stuck in traditional databases or across different backends, into one Dgraph
powered platform. This allows much more powerful queries across different
datasets without compromising on performance, allowing users to build smarter
apps and do real-time analytics.</p>

<p>Companies are learning that users don&rsquo;t want references, <strong>they want answers.</strong>
Having a high-quality knowledge graph allows them to serve their users better.
Many companies are in the process of building a knowledge graph and are using
Dgraph to serve that.</p>

<p><strong>Software is eating the world</strong> and social is eating the apps. Today&rsquo;s apps are
built keeping social interactions in mind, where relationships are as important
as data itself. Dgraph is being run as a primary database for many social apps.</p>

<p>In addition, graph use cases like referral and recommendation, real-time fraud
detection, customer 360, etc. are being run on Dgraph as well (see <a href="https://medium.com/redbus-in/how-redbus-built-a-scalable-inhouse-referral-system-93c643af2153">blog
post</a>). Something that we didn&rsquo;t forsee is the application of
Dgraph for tracking Kubernetes resources. Both <a href="https://github.com/vmware/purser">VMware</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/intuit/katlas">Intuit</a> have open source projects managing K8s resources via Dgraph.</p>

<p><strong>We ourselves have applied Dgraph as a general purpose database</strong> to serve data
typically associated with traditional ones.  Couple of years ago, we showcased
running <a href="https://blog.dgraph.io/post/sql-vs-dgraph/">Stack Overflow</a> on Dgraph and we were amazed by how much effort we
saved by simplifying the data model, avoiding data denormalization, and
retrieving a whole page worth of data in a single call to the DB. We cut the
backend code significantly, spending most of the effort on the rendering of the
results than on generating the content in the backend.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, we wrote <a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/flock">Flock</a> to live stream Tweets into
Dgraph, to showcase how effortless it is to load JSON data and gain the ability
to run complex queries.</p>

<h3 id="open-source-traction">Open Source Traction</h3>

<p>It is hard to measure open source traction. But, there&rsquo;s a common proxy that
open source projects use: <strong>GitHub activity</strong>, in particular something objective
like GitHub stars. <em>But looking at an absolute number of GitHub stars for projects
started in different years can be somewhat misleading.</em> An older project would have
more chance to gain a following than a younger project and therefore would always
appear to have more stars.</p>

<p>Instead, we chose to plot the rate of growth. We wrote some scripts to download
the GitHub star history and plotted GitHub stars by weeks since project
inception. That is, after week N, what was the star count for different projects
(50 weeks representing approximately an year). <strong>This allows us to compare their
star power when the projects were of same age.</strong> You can see the graphs here.</p>

<p><img src="/images/github-stars-graphdb.png" alt="Dgraph vs other graph DBs" />
<img src="/images/github-stars-all.png" alt="Dgraph vs the world" /></p>

<p><em>Here, the x-axis represents the number of weeks since project was first made
public on GitHub. And the y-axis is the star count as of that week<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</em></p>

<p>Compared against Neo4j, JanusGraph and ArangoDB, <strong><a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph">Dgraph</a> is the fastest growing
and one of the most popular open source graph databases.</strong> And it performs well
when put side-by-side with the most popular databases in other categories,
including InfluxDB and MongoDB.</p>

<p>In addition, Dgraph&rsquo;s own basic telemetry shows thousands of daily-active
instances running in the wild, together serving terabytes of data.</p>

<h3 id="the-next-generation-of-apps">The next generation of apps</h3>

<p>This is one of the bets we took very early on in <a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph">Dgraph</a>&rsquo;s journey. When looking
for a query language for the database back in 2015, we weren&rsquo;t happy with the
existing choices of Cypher and Gremlin. Incidentally, Facebook&rsquo;s GraphQL draft
spec had just been publicly <a href="https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/July2015/">released</a> in July 2015. <em>We really liked it.</em></p>

<p>So, back in 2015, we bet upon GraphQL being the primary lingua franca for Dgraph.
Over time, we had to make many modifications to make it work like a query
language for a database, causing it to become incompatible with the official spec.
<em>We called it <a href="https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/">GraphQL+-</a>.</em></p>

<p>While the idea was just to provide a simpler query language while allowing
returning subgraphs as result instead of just lists, over the last 3
years GraphQL+- has become one of the most liked features of Dgraph. At the same
time, GraphQL itself has taken the world by storm, with many companies replacing
their REST APIs with GraphQL.</p>

<p><strong>We envision Dgraph can play a lot bigger role in the next generation of
mobile and web apps being built on top of GraphQL.</strong> Dgraph is
special considering it is the only (or one of the rare) database to be built
around GraphQL. As such, it can completely execute a GraphQL query within a
single network call, while most other <em>&ldquo;GraphQL layer on DB&rdquo;</em> frameworks require
making multiple round-trips between the GraphQL layer and the underlying
database (not unlike what graph layers have to do). The former can provide much
better performance and scalability than the latter.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-are-we-going-to-do-with-the-money">So, what are we going to do with the money?</h3>

<p><img src="/images/Chand2.jpg" alt="Dgraph vs the world" /></p>

<p>One word, <strong>Hire.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We shall hire on the beaches, we shall hire on the grounds, we shall hire in the
fields and in the streets, we shall hire in the hills.&rdquo; &ndash; As heard on the radio.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With only $3M in funding since inception in early 2016, Dgraph has been
understaffed for the longest time. <strong>With this raise, we plan to expand our
engineering team significantly,</strong> both in our headquarters in San Francisco and
our remote office in Bengaluru, India. See our small tightly-knit <a href="https://dgraph.io/about">existing
team</a> and our <a href="https://dgraph.io/careers">openings here</a>.</p>

<p>The expanded team will allow us to respond much quicker to user feedback, which
is sometimes overwhelming. It will also allow us to build both open source and
enterprise features at a much faster pace. Finally, Dgraph as a service has been
one of the most asked for requests &mdash; this will give us a chance to consider
that effort seriously.</p>

<p><strong>Dgraph is in a unique position where it can apply the power of graphs on both
complex and seemingly mundane problems,</strong> while providing a good alternative
solution to <em>hammering</em> every problem with SQL. That was the vision with which
we raised 11.5 million dollars.</p>

<p>If you are curious about what our pitch deck to investors looked like, we have
decided to open source it. The deck has some sensitive slides removed, but
largely is the same as seen by investors. You can see it here (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JqHw_kGmEJE6WgnP4xMVXQ1b1CAWYOYK9eS09an2aI0/edit?usp=sharing">link</a>).</p>

<p><em>Congrats for making it to the end of our moonshot pitch.</em>
<em>Enjoy! And Keep Building Smart Apps. &mdash; Manish &amp; the Dgraph Labs Team</em></p>
