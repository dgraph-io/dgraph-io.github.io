    <meta name="twitter:description" content="One of the cornerstones of Dgraph is that it allows a flexible schema, which can be modified in a live system, without any downtime. This involves changing data types and adding or removing indices with a single ALTER command to match the needs of an application developer.
Dgraph supports indexing natively, which means common use cases around full-text search, regular expressions, date matching, geolocation queries, etc. can all be executed within Dgraph, while maintaining transactional guarantees."/>

<p>One of the cornerstones of Dgraph is that it allows a <em>flexible</em> schema, which
can be modified in a live system, without any downtime. This involves changing
data types and adding or removing indices with a single <code>ALTER</code> command to match
the needs of an application developer.</p>

<p>Dgraph supports indexing natively, which means common use cases around full-text
search, regular expressions, date matching, geolocation queries, etc. can all be
executed within Dgraph, while maintaining transactional guarantees. That is,
once a transaction is committed, not only the data, but also the indices are
updated and available to be queried. Indices are important to provide access to
various <a href="https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#functions">functions</a> that Dgraph supports.  Users can specify the types of
indices they want to build along with their schema.  For example, take a look at
the following schema:</p>

<pre><code>name: string @index(term, exact) .
post: string @index(fulltext) .
</code></pre>

<p>The schema specifies two predicates. The <code>name</code> predicate has indices to check
for equality and for terms in a name.  The <code>post</code> predicate on the other hand
generates an index that understands full text and is capable of checking for
related word (e.g a search for the word think would return posts with the word
thinking).</p>

<p>To build indices, Dgraph exposes a simple <a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/blob/7fa6c17568e475ac209f4f04cd3ac011a1b4677a/tok/tok.go#L56-L80">interface</a>, called <code>Tokenizer</code>.
Every tokenizer has a unique name and identifier, supports a certain type of
data (int, float, string, date, geo, etc.), and is sortable and/or lossy. That
answers if the output from the tokenizer can be used to run inequality functions
(sortable) and if tokens do not match the value of data exactly (lossy). In the
above case, <code>exact</code> index tokenizer is sortable, and not lossy. <code>term</code>
tokenizer is not sortable and is lossy. Dgraph internally uses these to
determine how to best execute various queries.</p>

<p>Dgraph currently supports 13 tokenizers in total, including <code>trigram</code> for
regular expressions and <code>geo</code> for geolocation indexing. It also
allows users to further extend this list by creating their own <a href="https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language#indexing-with-custom-tokenizers">custom</a> tokenizers
and attaching them to Dgraph process via Go plugins. You can see the available
tokenizers and the functions they support <a href="https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language#indexing">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p>Previously, when the schema was updated, Dgraph searched if the list of
tokenizers (i.e <code>term</code>, <code>fulltext</code>) had changed and regenerated the entire index
if that was the case.  A tokenizer refers to a strategy that is used to generate
tokens to insert into the index.  For example, if <code>{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Barack Obama&quot;}</code>
was added, the <code>exact</code> tokenizer would generate a single token with
value <code>Barack Obama</code> while the term tokenizer would generate two tokens
(<code>Barack</code> and <code>Obama</code>).  These tokens are used to generate a key that links
the token to the node containing the original data.</p>

<p>Rebuilding the entire index meant that Dgraph was performing a lot of extra work
in cases where only a portion of the previous tokenizers were added or removed.
As part of our continuous efforts to improve Dgraph, starting with upcoming
version 1.0.12, only the parts of the predicate index that need to be modified
are affected by schema updates. Along the way, we have refactored the reindexing
logic to make it follow better coding practices and a more strict separation of
concerns.</p>

<p>This blog entry will explore some of the strategies we used to clean up the code
and eventually support partial reindexing.</p>

<h3 id="indexing-showcase">Indexing showcase</h3>

<p>First let&rsquo;s add two new predicates, <code>name</code> and <code>inner_thoughts</code>. Let&rsquo;s index <code>inner_thoughts</code> with the <code>fulltext</code> tokenizer.</p>

<p><img src="/images/reindexing_1.gif" alt="Step 1" /></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s add a new node named &ldquo;Honey Badger&rdquo; and add its thoughts to the database.
Afterwards, we can query its thoughts using the <code>fulltext</code> capabilities.
For example, a search for &ldquo;getting&rdquo; will return this node because the words &ldquo;get&rdquo; and &ldquo;got&rdquo; appear inside the values of <code>inner_thoughts</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/reindexing_2.gif" alt="Step 2" /></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s delete some of the indices.
Afterwards, the previous query does not work anymore because it requires the <code>fulltext</code> index to function properly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/reindexing_3.gif" alt="Step 3" /></p>

<p>From the logs, we can observe that only the indices that changed were touched by the reindexing process.</p>

<h3 id="overview-of-the-previous-code">Overview of the previous code</h3>

<p>Previously, reindexing logic was split among three files.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/blob/2033183190db7bc445d300cb5b9ea829d1c58cea/worker/mutation.go">worker/mutation.go</a>:
This file decided whether the reindexing needed to happen by comparing the old and new schema updates.
The logic was different depending on whether the schema previously existed, further complicating things.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/blob/2033183190db7bc445d300cb5b9ea829d1c58cea/worker/index.go">worker/index.go</a>:
This file contained the reindexing functions that were called by <code>worker/mutation.go</code>.
These functions in turn were just very light wrappers around the functions in the <code>postings</code> package that do most of the work.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/blob/2033183190db7bc445d300cb5b9ea829d1c58cea/posting/index.go">posting/index.go</a>:
This file contained the main logic to delete and rebuild the indices.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="refactoring">Refactoring</h3>

<p>Before I embarked on the main task of supporting partial reindexing, I refactored the existing logic.
Out of the gate, there were several avenues to simplify the logic.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>worker/index.go</code> could be removed entirely.
The file was little more than a wrapper around other functions and obfuscated the logic without offering a compelling argument to keep using it.</p></li>

<li><p><code>posting/index.go</code> had multiple entry points to delete and rebuild each type of index (i.e reverse or count indices).
Instead, there should only be one exported function which decides which of these other functions should be called.</p></li>

<li><p><code>worker/mutation.go</code> had different logic for new predicates than for predicates that existed already, even though a lot of this logic was replicated.
This file was also tasked with comparing the old and new schemas and deciding whether each type of index needs to be rebuilt.
However, this is something that could be easily be done in <code>posting/index.go</code>, which would hide a lot of complexity from the <code>worker</code> package.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The basic idea behind the refactor was to let <code>worker/mutation.go</code> simply compile a list of the required information to perform the rebuild and move most of the logic to <code>posting/index.go</code>.</p>

<p>I settled on the following struct:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">type IndexRebuild struct {
	Attr          string // Predicate name.
	StartTs       uint64 // Start timestamp of the current transaction.
	OldSchema     *pb.SchemaUpdate
	CurrentSchema *pb.SchemaUpdate
}
</code></pre>

<p>This struct has a single method called <code>Run</code> that executes the entire reindexing process, which allowed me to get rid of the file <code>worker/index.go</code>.
The functions that rebuild each type of index are called by <code>Run</code>, thus preventing the caller from being exposed to unnecessary details.</p>

<p>Each of these functions, figures out what operation (i.e. no-op, delete index, or rebuild index) needs to be performed.
These functions share a similar pattern, expressed here in pseudo-code.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">type indexOp int

const (
	indexNoop    indexOp = iota // Index should be left alone.
	indexDelete          = iota // Index should be deleted.
	indexRebuild         = iota // Index should be deleted and rebuilt.
)

func performRebuildOfSomeIndexType(rb *IndexRebuild) err {
	op := rb.needsIndexRebuildOfThisType()

	// Nothing to do so just return
	if op == indexNoop {
		return nil
	}

	// Logic to delete the index goes here

	// In this case the index only needs to be deleted. For example, in the case
	// a predicate is deleted entirely.
	if op == indexDelete {
		return nil
	}

	// Logic to rebuild the index goes here
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>indexOp</code> is central to how I was able to get rid of the duplicate logic.
In the refactored code, a value of <code>indexRebuild</code> is returned when the schema is new or when the index needs to be rebuilt.
Thus, both cases can be handled by the same logic.
<code>indexNoop</code> and <code>indexDelete</code> do not cause the code to go into separate methods or large branches but rather cause the function to exit early depending on the circumstances.</p>

<h3 id="implementing-partial-reindexing">Implementing partial reindexing</h3>

<p>At this point I had cleaned up the code, but functionally Dgraph worked just as
before.  The function that adds the index tokens is called <code>addIndexMutations</code>
and is located inside <code>posting/index.go</code>.  At this point the function generated
the new index using the complete list of tokenizers from the schema. So in order
to support partial reindexing I did the following.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>needsIndexRebuild</code> was changed to not just an operation but a list of
tokenizers whose tokens need to be deleted and a list of tokenizers whose
tokens need to be rebuilt.
These lists are computed by calculating the difference between the set of
current and previous tokenizers.</p></li>

<li><p>The function that deletes the existing index was modified so that it accepts the name of a tokenizer.
This new function only deletes the entries that were previously added by that
tokenizer.  Deletion happens by calling that function over all the tokenizers
marked for deletion.</p></li>

<li><p><code>addIndexMutations</code> was changed to receive a list of tokenizers as a new argument (or rather, a new field in the struct passed to the function).
Only these tokenizers will be used to generate the tokens that need to be added to the index.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Interfaces should be as small as possible</strong>: Previously, the <code>worker</code>
package was exposed to a lot of the internal details of the logic inside the
<code>postings</code> package.
The split not only caused the code to be more difficult to understand but it
made the code brittle since changes inside of <code>posting</code> required changes to
other packages.  After refactoring, the changes to support partial reindexing
were completely transparent to other packages to the point I did not have to
modify <code>worker/mutations.go</code> at all.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Structs are your friends</strong>: Functions arguments and return values can
quickly get out of hand. The more arguments or return values a function has the
more brittle it becomes during refactorings.  Structs are a great way to reduce
the number of arguments or return values by allowing us to aggregate related
values under a single value.  We give up a little safety since the compiler will
not know which of the struct&rsquo;s members are required to be passed or returned.
However, the flexibility is worth the extra error-checking code.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Refactoring pays off</strong>: As mentioned above, investing time in simplifying
the code eventually helped me implement partial reindexing a great deal. I could
have tackled this task without refactoring, but I would only have made it more
difficult for myself and for future contributors.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>As we strive to improve the performance of Dgraph, it is also important that we
manage and reduce the complexity of the code and follow best practices to the
best of our ability.  Not only does that make our jobs easier, but it makes our
codebase more welcoming to newcomers.</p>
