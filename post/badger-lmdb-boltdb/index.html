  <meta name="twitter:description" content="If you have been following us, you may know that we released Badger a few months ago. Badger is a simple, efficient, and persistent key-value store, written in a hipster language. Even though it is not at v1.0 yet, we have already received a great response from the community. As of writing, Badger has 2350 stars on Github, and there have been lots of discussions online since the release announcement."/>

          <div class="article-content"><p>If you have been following us, you may know that we <a href="https://blog.dgraph.io/post/badger/">released
Badger</a> a few months ago. Badger is a simple, efficient, and
persistent key-value store, written in <a href="http://n-gate.com/hackernews/2017/05/14/"><em>a hipster language</em></a>. Even though
it is not at v1.0 yet, we have already received a great response from the
community. As of writing, Badger has 2350 stars <a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger">on Github</a>, and
there have been
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/6b57aa/badger_a_faster_kv_store/">lots</a>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/6jm2db/badger_fastest_keyvalue_store_in_go/">of</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14335931">discussions</a> online
since the release announcement.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://blog.dgraph.io/post/badger/">launch post</a> contained benchmarks evaluating Badger against <a href="http://rocksdb.org/">RocksDB</a>.
RocksDB was the store we were using before we decided to replace it and write
our own, so it made sense to benchmark against it. However, a lot of
people <a href="https://twitter.com/tobym/status/882760757615759361">have</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/6jm2db/badger_fastest_keyvalue_store_in_go/">been</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hyc_symas/status/884001285879599104">curious</a> about how Badger fares against stores like
<a href="https://symas.com/lmdb/">LMDB</a> and <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt">BoltDB</a>.</p>
<p>In the launch post, we had mentioned that recent improvements
to SSDs might make B+-trees a viable option for high write throughput.
Also, the reason B+ trees are considered good for reads is that they have low read
amplification. Badger's design also provides for a significantly lower read
amplification compared to other LSM tree based key-value stores. So, we decided
it was worth benchmarking Badger against these stores.</p>
<p><em>It will be helpful if you have read our <a href="https://blog.dgraph.io/post/badger/">earlier post</a> from when
we launched Badger, but it is not required.</em></p>
<p><strong>Based on our benchmarks,</strong> Badger is at least 1.7✕-22.3✕ faster than LMDB and BoltDB
when doing random writes. Sorted range iteration is a bit slower when value
size is small, but as value sizes increase, Badger is 4✕-111✕ times faster. On
the flip side, Badger is currently up to 1.9✕ slower when doing random reads.</p>
<p>Thus, Badger's unique design significantly outperforms these stores on write
throughput and iteration latency, while being only slightly slower when it comes
to random reads.</p>

<h2 id="some-notes-about-architecture">Some notes about architecture</h2>
<h3 id="lmdb-and-boltdb">LMDB and BoltDB</h3>
<p>BoltDB started out as a port of LMDB to Go but has somewhat diverged since then.
While LMDB heavily focuses on raw performance, Bolt has focused on simplicity
and ease of use. However, they both share the same design, so describing LMDB should
be sufficient.</p>
<p>LMDB provides a key-value stored using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree">B+ trees</a>. It has ACID
semantics and support for transactions. It does not do any background work and
has a crash resilient design that uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control">MVCC</a> instead of locking. This means readers
operate on an isolated snapshot of the database and don’t block. The codebase
is quite small and portable, so LMDB runs across multiple platforms including
Android, BSD, and Solaris. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEa5sAh-kVk&amp;t=10s">talk by Howard Chu</a> at Databaseology
2015 goes into much more details about LMDB’s design.</p>
<p>It is generally understood that B+ tree based stores are ideal for workloads
which are read intensive.</p>
<h3 id="badger">Badger</h3>
<p>Badger belongs to a family of key-value stores that are characterized by a
design that uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree">log-structured merge-tree</a> (LSM tree). Popular
stores in this category include <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb">LevelDB</a> and <a href="http://rocksdb.org/">RocksDB</a>.</p>
<p>LSM tree based stores provide high write performance by sequentially writing
key-value pairs in memory in the foreground, and then arranging them in
multi-tiered levels on disk in the background. This approach is not without
tradeoffs though. Values are written multiple times when arranging them in the
tree (known as <em>write amplification</em>) and a single read might need to read
multiple levels in the LSM tree before finding a value (known as <em>read
amplification</em>).</p>
<p>Badger’s design is based on a paper titled <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/fast16/fast16-papers-lu.pdf">‘WiscKey: Separating Keys
from Values in SSD-conscious Storage’</a> (referred to as the WISCKEY
paper from now on). Here is an excerpt from the paper touching on the key
design aspects:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“To realize an SSD-optimized key-value store,
WiscKey includes four critical ideas. First, WiscKey separates keys from
values, keeping only keys in the LSM-tree and the values in a separate log
file. Second, to deal with unsorted values (which necessitate random access
during range queries), WiscKey uses the parallel random-read characteristic of
SSD devices. Third, WiscKey utilizes unique crash-consistency and
garbage collection techniques to efficiently manage the value log. Finally,
WiscKey optimizes performance by removing the LSM-tree log without sacrificing
consistency, thus reducing system-call overhead from small writes.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Badger's design reduces both the read and write amplification</strong> seen in other LSM
tree based stores. Keys tend to be much smaller in size than values, so by
separating keys from values and prefix-diffing the keys, Badger significantly
reduces the size of LSM tree.
Badger does not acquire any global mutex locks, allowing reads to happen
concurrently while writes are going on, to achieve a high read-write throughput.
It is very crash resilient, as we tested and explained in <a href="https://blog.dgraph.io/post/alice/">this blog
post</a>.</p>
<p>While there are differences in implementation, design details are available
in <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/fast16/fast16-papers-lu.pdf">the paper</a>. It also contains a good overview of LSM trees and databases
using them.</p>

<h2 id="benchmarking">Benchmarking</h2>
<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>The benchmarking setup was identical to the one we used when benchmarking
Badger <a href="https://blog.dgraph.io/post/badger/">against RocksDB</a>. Therefore the numbers should be
comparable as well. We have made many optimizations, fixes, and improvements to
Badger since, which should reflect in the numbers below.</p>
<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
<p>To benchmark the stores, we measured 4 things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data loading performance</strong>:  Populating the database with a pre-specified
number of keys.</li>
<li><strong>Output Size</strong>: Size of the data set on disk.</li>
<li><strong>Random Key Lookup Performance</strong>: Generating a random key and reading its
value from the fully populated store (<em>this was done several million times
using Go benchmarking tools, and an average was taken</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Sorted Range Iteration Performance</strong>: Iterating through 2 million keys in
sorted order.</li>
</ul>
<p>We performed benchmarks on 3 different data sets, varying the number of keys
and the value size (in bytes) associated with the keys.</p>
<table>

<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Value Size (bytes)</th>

<h4 id="hardware">Hardware</h4>
<p>All benchmarks were done on a dedicated AWS EC2 i3.large instance (us-east-2
region) running Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS (HVM) with 16GB RAM. This instance
comes with a locally mounted 470GB SSD drive. The benchmarks were performed on
data stored on the local SSD, which provides 100K IOPS with 4KB block sizes.
Note that the root and home directories are mounted on EBS storage which has
very low IOPS.</p>
<p>We deliberately chose an instance with RAM size (16GB) lesser than the data set
sizes. This provides a good setup for benchmarking and is representative of our
use-cases for Badger, where data sizes are several times the size of RAM
available.</p>
<h4 id="software">Software</h4>
<h5 id="lmdb"><strong>LMDB</strong></h5>
<p>We used the <a href="https://github.com/bmatsuo/lmdb-go">lmdb-go</a> bindings to LMDB, which comes with its own embedded copy
of the lmdb C source code. It is the most up to date binding available in Go
and is <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/bmatsuo/lmdb-go/lmdb">well documented</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks to Howard Chu</strong> for looking at the benchmarking code for lmdb-go. He
helped us <a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger-bench/pull/5">tune the code</a>, and also <a href="https://github.com/bmatsuo/lmdb-go/issues/118">pointed
out</a> that we should be using <code>lmdb.NoReadahead</code> flag
in our benchmarks when data size is larger than RAM.</p>
<p>We ran into a couple of issues with LMDB APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Several hours into populating data into LMDB for one of our benchmarks, we
suddenly saw a crash. After investigation, we realized that LMDB needs a
configuration value for the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/bmatsuo/lmdb-go/lmdb#Env.SetMapSize">maximum map size</a> of the database.
This needs to be determined upfront while opening the database. LMDB will not expand
automatically as data size increases. To get around it, we set it to a
calculated large number and re-populated the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During our initial benchmarking runs, the hit ratio (found vs. miss) and hence
read performance of LMDB was significantly affected by the value of
GOMAXPROCS. We could not figure out why this was happening. This issue got
compounded by an oversight in our code which was correctly handling error
inside the view transaction, but not outside it. A few days into this issue,
we fixed the error handling and realized that a large number of reads were
failing, because the maximum number of concurrent readers had to be set
explicitly, using the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/bmatsuo/lmdb-go/lmdb#Env.SetMaxReaders"><code>SetMaxReaders</code></a> API function.  <strong>From a
Go perspective, this is strange.</strong> This would require tracking how many
concurrent reads are going on at a given moment, and restrict them to a
pre-specified number. In a highly concurrent Go based system like Dgraph, this
would be a severe limitation. We got around the limitation by setting the
maximum number of readers to a number based on the benchmarks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While none of these limitations are deal breakers, they do present unfamiliar
obstacles for a Go programmer using LMDB.  In comparison, BoltDB and Badger
do not require you to specify a maximum map size, or a maximum number of readers in
advance.</p>
<h5 id="bolt"><strong>Bolt</strong></h5>
<p>We used the BoltDB source <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt">hosted on Github</a>. Note that there is a
fork of BoltDB, called <a href="https://github.com/coreos/bbolt">bbolt</a> maintained by CoreOS. However, we decided to stick to
the original version which is considered complete by its maintainer. We did not
run into any issues when using BoltDB APIs. They are clean and well documented.</p>
<h5 id="badger-1"><strong>Badger</strong></h5>
<p>We ran the benchmarks against code in <a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger">Badger repo</a> on Github, at
commit <a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger/tree/64df7f57d9ee20d7b28de4a3eea90bf8d7310a77">64df7f5</a>. This included a significant change in
the way we read the value log, where we switched from using standard file I/O
to memory-mapping the files before reading. We will cover this in more detail
in the sections below.</p>
<h4 id="code">Code</h4>
<p>All the benchmarking code and results are available on Github in the
<a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger-bench">badger-bench</a> repo. To make the benchmarks transparent and repeatable, we have
recorded all the steps in detail in our <a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger-bench/blob/master/BENCH-lmdb-bolt.md">benchmarking log</a>.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Numbers and charts can also be found in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hz9XHk8v45qHhjr2DwXhblrhtg7pMim-GRLYNqRKCK0/edit?usp=sharing">this spreadsheet</a>.</p>
<h4 id="data-loading">Data Loading</h4>
<p><a href="/images/lmdb-bolt-bench/data-loading.png"><img src="/images/lmdb-bolt-bench/data-loading.png" alt="Data loading performance"></a></p>
<p>The results of this benchmark are pretty unequivocal. <strong>Badger is significantly
faster than both LMDB and BoltDB in loading data.</strong> The factor of speedup ranges
from 1.7✕ to 22.3✕. Bolt DB degrades pretty badly in the 16kb data set with a
throughput of only 32000 key-value pairs a minute.</p>
<p>B+ trees do not have very good write performance, and these benchmarks
support that claim. Writing KV pairs randomly to Bolt or LMDB leads to a lot
of random seeks on the disk. Badger, on the other hand, writes to an LSM tree where all writes are sequential. Moreover, the actual values are written in a log elsewhere using sequential writes. This leads to much better disk utilization and throughput.</p>
<p>Some additional technical notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Badger provides an API method called <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/badger#KV.BatchSet"><code>BatchSet</code></a> which
batches up a series of writes to the value log. This can significantly speed
up bulk-loading. BoltDB and lmdb-go do not have an equivalent API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BoltDB provides an API method called <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/boltdb/bolt#DB.Batch"><code>Batch()</code></a>, which can be
used to achieve some concurrency while writing to it. The results
above are using this call, but we did not notice a very significant
difference for this specific benchmark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lmdb-go has a limitation in its API when it comes to writing to the
store using multiple goroutines. Here is what the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/bmatsuo/lmdb-go/lmdb#hdr-Caveats">API docs
say</a>: <em>Write transactions (those created without the
<code>Readonly</code> flag) must be created in a goroutine that has been locked to its
thread by calling the function <code>runtime.LockOSThread</code>. Furthermore all
methods on such transactions must be called from the goroutine which created
them. This is a fundamental limitation of LMDB even when using the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/bmatsuo/lmdb-go/lmdb#hdr-Environment">NoTLS</a>
flag (which the package always uses).</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="data-set-size">Data Set Size</h4>
<p><a href="/images/lmdb-bolt-bench/data-size.png"><img src="/images/lmdb-bolt-bench/data-size.png" alt="Data set size"></a></p>
<p>We did not notice any patterns w.r.t. final data set sizes among the stores.
Bolt and LMDB store data in one large file and keys and values are stored
together. Badger stores data in two different kinds of files: one for LSM data
which contains keys and pointer to values, and value log files which contain the
actual values.</p>
<h4 id="random-key-lookup">Random Key Lookup</h4>
<p><a href="/images/lmdb-bolt-bench/random-lookup.png"><img src="/images/lmdb-bolt-bench/random-lookup.png" alt="Random Key Lookup latency"></a></p>
<p><strong>LMDB has the lowest read latencies</strong> across all the data sets.
Badger goes neck-to-neck against LMDB in 1kB value, but in
other values are up to 2x slow.
BoltDB, on the other hand, has lower latencies than Badger for the 128B and 16kB
datasets but shows higher latency in the 1kB data set.</p>
<p>We were pleasantly surprised by these results. <strong>Badger holds pretty well</strong>
against both the stores, never performing particularly worse than others, and at
least in one instance, beating BoltDB. This is a particularly important feat
because random key lookup is the weakest spot for LSM based KV stores.  LSM-tree
suffers from read-amplification. It needs to look for the key in multiple places
before returning.</p>
<p>Badger's design handles read amplification in two ways. It first significantly
reduces the size of LSM tree by separating keys from values, and secondly,
minimizes the latency by keeping the (much smaller) LSM tree entirely in RAM.
This makes Badger much faster than other LSM-tree based key-value stores like
RocksDB and a lot more competitive with B+-trees.</p>
<p><em>Note that LMDB was slower in our initial benchmarks before Howard Chu <a href="https://github.com/bmatsuo/lmdb-go/issues/118">pointed
out</a> that we should be setting the
<code>lmdb.NoReadahead</code> flag when opening the store. This got us thinking, and we
realized that this could apply to Badger as well. We already had a feature
request to memory-map the value log files. We decided to <a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger/commit/b9aae1b3895c41176770406d66d6614bf525f80f">give that a
shot</a>, and also disabled readahead using the <code>madvise</code> system
call. When we ran the benchmarks for the 16kB dataset after this change, we
were able to reduce the latency from  22µs to 3.8µs.</em></p>
<h4 id="sorted-range-iteration">Sorted Range Iteration</h4>
<p><a href="/images/lmdb-bolt-bench/range-iteration.png"><img src="/images/lmdb-bolt-bench/range-iteration.png" alt="Sorted range iteration"></a></p>
<p>For the data store with 128B value size, Badger is about 1.5✕-1.6✕ slower than
lmdb-go and BoltDB. However, Badger’s performance improves as value sizes get
bigger. <strong>Badger is anywhere between 4✕-111✕ times faster</strong> when iterating over
data stores with 1kb and 16kb value size. Badger’s design allows it to prefetch
values in the background during iteration. This is controlled by an option and
is enabled by default. The <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/fast16/fast16-papers-lu.pdf">WISCKEY paper</a> touches upon this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“To make range queries efficient, WiscKey leverages
the parallel I/O characteristic of SSD devices to prefetch
values from the vLog during range queries. The underlying
idea is that, with SSDs, only keys require special
attention for efficient retrieval. So long as keys are retrieved
efficiently, range queries can use parallel random
reads for efficiently retrieving values.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our <a href="https://blog.dgraph.io/post/badger/">launch post</a>, we mentioned that there were shortcomings with iteration in
Badger because we were unable to realize the high SSD IOPS via Go. After much
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/jPb_h3TvlKE/discussion">discussion and digging</a>, we realized that setting
GOMAXPROCS to a high enough number (say 128), allows us to realize the high
IOPS, making Badger significantly faster for key-value iterations.</p>
<p>Badger’s iterator API also allows what we call <strong><em>key-only</em> iteration.</strong> In this
mode, we iterate only over the LSM tree and do not read the values in the value
log files at all. This means that most of the time, iterations do not touch the
disk and happen blazingly fast. This functionality is unique to Badger among
all the other key-value stores compared.</p>
<p>Key-only iterations are very useful in various applications which only need to
iterate over keys, for splitting tablets or estimating data sizes based on key
prefixes. At Dgraph, we use them to estimate the size of tablets, run filters and only
retrieve values for a much smaller subset of keys.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>LMDB</strong> implementation in Go outperformed both BoltDB and Badger in terms of
random read latency, but was significantly slower for sorted range iteration
and had several mind-boggling API limitations. If you have a random read
intensive workload, LMDB Go might be a suitable store for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>BoltDB</strong> didn't really stand apart in any of the four criteria. It was the
slowest in data loading, fell well behind Badger in sorted range iteration
(though outperformed LMDB), and gave conflicting results w.r.t. random key lookup.
However, it did have a clean and well-documented APIs and supports ACID
transactions.</p>
<p><strong>One of the big reasons</strong> we wrote Badger was that we were having difficulty understanding the behavior of Cgo APIs accessing RocksDB
from within Go. Using a store written in pure Go allows better visibility
into what’s going on using Go’s profiling tools. It also allows more
convenient control over concurrent operations using Go’s native support for
goroutines. So BoltDB and Badger might be better choices over LMDB in this scenario.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Badger</strong> significantly outperformed its competition in both write throughput and
sorted range iteration. It performed slightly worse in random key lookup but
did not deteriorate in performance as badly as competition did in other
categories.  For a workload which has a mix of reads and writes in any
proportion (even 90-10), Badger is a <strong>clear choice.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="further-work">Further Work</h2>
<p>At this point, the biggest aim for Badger is to stabilize the API and bring it
past v1.0. Various projects like <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> use Badger, and there's an outstanding
Github issue to integrate Badger with <a href="https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve/issues/591">Bleve</a>.</p>
<p>Also, we are considering adding transactional support into Badger.
So, if you think it would be useful to you, <a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger/issues/230">let us know</a>.</p>
<h2 id="parting-thoughts">Parting thoughts</h2>
<p>In this post, we have done a comprehensive survey of how <a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger">Badger</a> compares
against two popular options for key-value stores in Go. <a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger">Badger</a> is still quite
new, and we are excited about what lies ahead for the project.</p>
<p>We put months of effort into ensuring the benchmarks were impartial, correctly
set up and executed. Many a times this process was laborious and frustrating, but we
were excited about the possibility of learning a few things from other
key-value stores and improving Badger; <em>which we did</em>.  These benchmarks make us
even more convinced of the effort that Dgraph team has put into building Badger
from scratch. We have built a solid offering not only to be used within Dgraph,
but for anyone looking for a key-value store in Go.</p>
<p>We would love to hear from you regarding what you think we should be focusing
on in the future. If you have any comments or questions, please head to
