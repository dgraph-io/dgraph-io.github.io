      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a years since BadgerDB v1.5.0 was released. While both the
project and the community surrounding it have changed a lot, not many new
releases have seen the light of the day.  Happily, this changes today, as we
release BadgerDB v1.6.0 and announce our plans for BadgerDB v2 coming out next
week!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
