      <description>In this tutorial we will build a To-Do List application using React JavaScript library and Dgraph as a backend database. We will use dgraph-js-http &amp;mdash; a library designed to greatly simplify the life of JavaScript developers when accessing Dgraph databases.
The tutorial is split into several steps:
 Creating a React App
 Starting a local Dgraph server using docker-compose
 Connecting to Dgraph from JavaScript and fetching data</description>
