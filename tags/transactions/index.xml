      <description>When we started working on Badger, the aim was to keep things stupid simple. We needed to get rid of Cgo from Dgraph codebase, while also building something which can perform really well. We wanted to create it for ourselves and the broader Go community. Go has been a language of choice for many databases, and providing a performant native Go key-value store seemed like a win for everyone.
As Badger is gaining popularity, we see the limitations of our initial choices.</description>
