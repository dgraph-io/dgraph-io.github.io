      <description>When I introduce myself and explain what we are building at Dgraph Labs, I am typically asked if I worked at Facebook, or if what I&amp;rsquo;m building is inspired by Facebook. A lot of people know about the efforts at Facebook to serve their social graph, because they have published multiple articles about the graph infrastructure they put together.
Word from Google has been limited to serving Knowledge Graph, but nothing has been said about the internal infrastructure which makes this happen.</description>
