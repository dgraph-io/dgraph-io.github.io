      <description>&lt;p&gt;Candidate &lt;strong&gt;REJECTED&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 out of 5 interviewers had liked the candidate. I was one of the 4. He had received either above or very close to 3.0, which is a good score. The interviewer who didn&amp;rsquo;t like the candidate had been at Google since early 2004. And he didn&amp;rsquo;t like the candidate&amp;rsquo;s joke question about whether he was very rich because he joined before Google went IPO. &lt;em&gt;I guess he wasn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
