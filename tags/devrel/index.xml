      <description>GraphQL has taken the app development world by storm because of its immense benefits. GraphQL adoption by UI development teams has brought in a new wave of flexibility in API design, productivity across frontend-backend teams, intuitiveness in expressing UI data requirements, and accessibility to powerful tooling. These benefits are why many tech companies, including Facebook, Airbnb, Paypal, GitHub, and Shopify, are embracing GraphQL.
Designing the GraphQL schema is often the first step in your app development journey using GraphQL.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the eighth episode of getting started with Dgraph.
In the previous episode, we learned about building a twitter-like user-search feature using Dgraph&amp;rsquo;s fuzzy search.
In this episode, we&amp;rsquo;ll build a graph of tourist locations around San Francisco and help our Zoologist friend, Mary, and her team in their mission to conserve birds using Dgraph&amp;rsquo;s geolocation capabilities.
You might have used Google to find the restaurants near you or to find the shopping centres within a mile of your current location.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the seventh episode of getting started with Dgraph. In the previous episode, we learned about building advanced text searches on social graphs in Dgraph, by modeling tweets as an example. We queried the tweets using the full-text and trigram indices and implemented full-text and regular-expression based search on the tweets.
In this tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll continue exploring Dgraph&amp;rsquo;s string querying capabilities using the twitter model from the fifth and the sixth tutorial.</description>

      <description>Dgraph is an open-source, transactional, distributed, native Graph database. Dgraph is optimized for high-performance reads and writes. It can serve queries and mutations with low latency and high throughput, even when they involve deep joins and traversals.
Much of Dgraph&amp;rsquo;s advanced performance capabilities come from Badger. Badger is the embedded key-value store that is responsible for storing all of Dgraph&amp;rsquo;s data.
Badger itself is not distributed, Dgraph implements a layer on top of it to provide the distributed capabilities.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the fourth episode of getting started with Dgraph.
In the previous episode, we learned about Datatypes, Indexing, Filtering, and Reverse traversals in Dgraph.
In this episode, we&amp;rsquo;ll learn about using multi-language strings and operations on them using the language tags.
Strings and languages Strings values in Dgraph are of UTF-8 format. Dgraph also supports values for string predicate types in multiple languages. The multi-lingual capability is particularly useful to build features, which requires you to store the same information in multiple languages.</description>
