      <description>I recently started working at Dgraph Labs in Bengaluru as a Software Engineer. One of the first issues that I worked on was related to the Dgraph&amp;rsquo;s datetime datatype. This article covers how I discovered and resolved the issue. The article assumes a basic understanding of Dgraph, but you can learn everything you need in docs.dgraph.io.
Bug Discovery While working on Flock, I observed that timestamp comparisons were not working correctly in Dgraph when the data or query had timezone information in it.</description>

      <description>Dgraph is rapidly gaining reputation as an easy to use database to build apps upon. Many new users of Dgraph have existing relational databases that they want to migrate from. In particular, we get asked a lot about how to migrate data from MySQL to Dgraph.

      <description>With GDPR passing in the EU on April 14th, 2016, users on the Internet are demanding protection of their privacy and data from Internet companies. The regulation has profound implications. Many companies take the law and users&amp;rsquo; demand seriously: they start encrypting data for traffic within their data centers, and employing strict control on who can access users&amp;rsquo; data. The Dgraph team takes full notice of that. Access control on the data stored in Dgraph is very important to our enterprise customers.</description>
