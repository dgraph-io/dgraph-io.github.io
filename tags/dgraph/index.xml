      <description>There would be no Dgraph 2.0. After 4+ years of releasing Dgraph, we have decided to switch away from Semantic Versioning. The next release of Dgraph would be 20.03.0. In this post, we talk about why.
Versioning is a complex and opinionated topic. Over the years, weâ€™ve gotten great feedback from our users about our releases. We realize that while making frequent releases helps our users get access to new features and bug fixes, these can also introduce unpredictable breaking changes.</description>

      <description>I recently started working at Dgraph Labs in Bengaluru as a Software Engineer. One of the first issues that I worked on was related to the Dgraph&amp;rsquo;s datetime datatype. This article covers how I discovered and resolved the issue. The article assumes a basic understanding of Dgraph, but you can learn everything you need in docs.dgraph.io.
Bug Discovery While working on Flock, I observed that timestamp comparisons were not working correctly in Dgraph when the data or query had timezone information in it.</description>

      <description>With GDPR passing in the EU on April 14th, 2016, users on the Internet are demanding protection of their privacy and data from Internet companies. The regulation has profound implications. Many companies take the law and users&amp;rsquo; demand seriously: they start encrypting data for traffic within their data centers, and employing strict control on who can access users&amp;rsquo; data. The Dgraph team takes full notice of that. Access control on the data stored in Dgraph is very important to our enterprise customers.</description>
