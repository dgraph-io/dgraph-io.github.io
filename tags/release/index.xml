      <description>Dgraph is an open-source, transactional, distributed, native graph database. Ever since the internet explosion, the data not just has been growing in size, but also in its complexity and connectedness. Dgraph is built as an effort to enable and simplify the development of scalable cloud applications that could continue to thrive even when the data is highly connected and involved.
Set on this path, embracing open source all along the way, the first production-ready, major release v1.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a years since BadgerDB v1.5.0 was released. While both the
project and the community surrounding it have changed a lot, not many new
releases have seen the light of the day.  Happily, this changes today, as we
release BadgerDB v1.6.0 and announce our plans for BadgerDB v2 coming out next
week!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
