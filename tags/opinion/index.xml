      <description>Ajay Kulkarni, the co-founder of Timescale DB wrote an article about “Why SQL is beating NoSQL,” which became an instant hit. He made a compelling case about how SQL is making a comeback, citing Google Spanner and CockroachDB.
The analysis was mostly agreeable, except for one major flaw. It is not SQL which is making a comeback, its NoSQL which is morphing into providing a familiar interface.
Bigtable and MapReduce were developed to deal with an enormous amount of data at Google.</description>
