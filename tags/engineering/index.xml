      <description>I recently started working at Dgraph Labs in Bengaluru as a Software Engineer. One of the first issues that I worked on was related to the Dgraph&#39;s datetime datatype. This article covers how I discovered and resolved the issue. The article assumes a basic understanding of Dgraph, but you can learn everything you need in docs.dgraph.io.
Bug Discovery While working on Flock, I observed that timestamp comparisons were not working correctly in Dgraph when the data or query had timezone information in it.</description>
