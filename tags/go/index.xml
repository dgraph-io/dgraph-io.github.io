Every database system requires a smart cache. That is, a cache that keeps the most frequently or recently accessed items and has a configurable memory utilization limit.
Being a graph database, Dgraph can access thousands&amp;mdash;even millions&amp;mdash;of keys per query, depending upon the number of intermediate results.</description>

      <description>One of the cornerstones of Dgraph is that it allows a flexible schema, which can be modified in a live system, without any downtime. This involves changing data types and adding or removing indices with a single ALTER command to match the needs of an application developer.
Dgraph supports indexing natively, which means common use cases around full-text search, regular expressions, date matching, geolocation queries, etc. can all be executed within Dgraph, while maintaining transactional guarantees.</description>
